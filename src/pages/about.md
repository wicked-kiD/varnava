Hey there! I'm Artsiom Varnava, a guy from Belarus living in Poland. I work in frontend development and in my free time, I'm into American football, making music and riding motorcycles for that extra thrill.

On this page, I want to share interesting thoughts, personal stories and maybe give you a peek into my visual adventures. It's like a digital treasure chest of my various interests. I hope you find something cool in this mix.

As I keep adding stuff here, think of this description as a work in progress - a canvas that's ready for more expression. Stay tuned for updates and cool finds!
